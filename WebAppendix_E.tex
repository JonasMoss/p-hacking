\section*{Web Appendix E: Additional simulations}
In this section we provide details for two additional simulations using different priors on $\tau$. The setup for the simulations are the same as in Section 3 in the paper. The uniform prior has support on $[0, 3]$. The inverse Gamma prior has shape parameter $2$ and scale parameter $1/2$. These parameters were chosen in order to make the prior have sufficient mass close to $0$. All results are based on $N = 100$ replications.
